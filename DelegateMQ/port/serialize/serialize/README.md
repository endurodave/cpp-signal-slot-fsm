# MessageSerialize

A robust, header-only C++ binary serialization library designed for DelegateMQ. It provides a simple yet powerful framework for marshaling C++ objects, primitives, and STL containers into binary streams.

## Features

- **Header-Only**: No external dependencies beyond the C++ Standard Library.
- **Endianness Aware**: Uses a little-endian wire format. Automatically handles byte-swapping on big-endian hosts.
- **STL Support**: Native support for `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::string`, and `std::wstring`.
- **Custom Allocators**: Fully compatible with custom allocators, including DelegateMQ's `xlist`, `xvector`, etc.
- **Versioning**: Supports forward and backward compatibility for user-defined objects.
- **Type Safety**: Uses compile-time checks to ensure only supported types are serialized.
- **Pointer Support**: Supports serializing containers of pointers with automatic memory allocation during deserialization.
- **Stream Verification**: Includes runtime and compile-time checks (via `is_seekable` trait) to ensure streams support the required seeking operations.

## Stream Requirements

- **Seekable**: The library requires seekable streams (e.g., `std::stringstream`, `std::fstream`) to handle object versioning and size backfilling. Non-seekable streams (like sockets or `std::cout`) will trigger a runtime error.
- **Binary Mode**: Always open files or streams in **binary mode** (`std::ios::binary`). Failure to do so may lead to data corruption due to automatic newline translations (especially on Windows).

## Basic Usage

### Serializing Primitives

```cpp
#include "msg_serialize.h"
#include <sstream>

serialize ms;
int value = 123;
std::stringstream ss;

// Write to stream
ms.write(ss, value);

// Read from stream
int outValue;
ms.read(ss, outValue);
```

### Custom Serializable Objects

User-defined types must inherit from `serialize::I` and implement the `read()` and `write()` methods.

```cpp
struct MyData : public serialize::I {
    int id = 0;
    std::string name;

    // Serialize object to stream
    std::ostream& write(serialize& ms, std::ostream& os) const override {
        ms.write(os, id);
        ms.write(os, name);
        return os;
    }

    // Deserialize object from stream
    std::istream& read(serialize& ms, std::istream& is) override {
        ms.read(is, id);
        ms.read(is, name);
        return is;
    }
};
```

### STL Containers and Custom Allocators

The library handles standard containers and those using custom allocators (like fixed-block pools) automatically.

```cpp
xlist<int> myList = {1, 2, 3};
std::stringstream ss;
serialize ms;

ms.write(ss, myList);

xlist<int> outList;
ms.read(ss, outList);
```

## Advanced Features

### Versioning & Compatibility

When serializing objects derived from `serialize::I`, the library records the object size in the stream. 
- **Forward Compatibility**: If a receiver gets a newer (larger) version of an object, it reads what it knows and safely skips the remaining bytes.
- **Backward Compatibility**: If a receiver gets an older (smaller) version, it reads the available data and leaves the remaining members at their default values.

### Pointer Containers

When serializing `std::vector<T*>` or `std::list<T*>`, the library:
1.  Writes a boolean flag for each element indicating if it's null.
2.  For non-null elements, it serializes the pointed-to object.
3.  During deserialization, it calls `new T` to recreate the objects. 

*Note: The caller is responsible for managing the memory of objects created during pointer container deserialization.*
